# Bug Fixes Report

## Summary
This report documents **3 critical bugs** found and fixed in the Furikake CLI codebase. The bugs ranged from security vulnerabilities to logic errors that could cause application crashes.

## Bug #1: JSON Parsing Vulnerability in HTTP Filter Endpoint
**File:** `app/http/server/endpoints/filter/filter.ts`  
**Lines:** 97  
**Severity:** High (Security Vulnerability)  
**Type:** Missing Error Handling / Security Issue

### Description
The HTTP filter endpoint directly parsed JSON from an LLM response without proper error handling. This created a security vulnerability where:
- Malicious or malformed JSON could crash the application
- No logging of parsing failures made debugging difficult
- The application could become unstable when receiving unexpected LLM responses

### Root Cause
```typescript
// VULNERABLE CODE:
const toolNames = JSON.parse(responseText);
```

The code assumed the LLM would always return valid JSON, but this assumption is dangerous when dealing with external services.

### Fix Applied
Added proper error handling with try-catch blocks:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
let toolNames;
try {
  toolNames = JSON.parse(responseText);
} catch (parseError) {
  console.error("Failed to parse JSON from LLM response:", parseError, "Response:", responseText);
  return { error: "Invalid JSON format in LLM response" };
}
```

### Impact
- **Before:** Application could crash on malformed LLM responses
- **After:** Graceful error handling with proper logging and user feedback

## Bug #2: Improper Input Handling in Package Installation
**File:** `app/packages/add/index.ts`  
**Lines:** 41-45  
**Severity:** High (Logic Error)  
**Type:** Runtime Error / User Experience Issue

### Description
The package installation process used incorrect syntax for reading user input from stdin. The code attempted to iterate over `console` as an async iterable, which would cause a runtime error:

### Root Cause
```typescript
// BROKEN CODE:
for await (const line of console) {
  input = line;
  break;
}
```

`console` is not an async iterable object, so this code would throw a TypeError at runtime.

### Fix Applied
Implemented proper stdin handling using Node.js streams:
```typescript
// FIXED CODE:
const input = await new Promise<string>((resolve) => {
  process.stdin.setEncoding('utf8');
  process.stdin.once('data', (data) => {
    resolve(data.toString().trim());
  });
  process.stdin.resume();
});
```

### Impact
- **Before:** Application would crash when prompting users for input during failed package installations
- **After:** Proper user input handling that works reliably

## Bug #3: Missing Error Handling in Unix Socket JSON Parsing
**File:** `app/helpers/UnixSocketTransport.ts`  
**Lines:** 113-117  
**Severity:** Medium (Security/Debugging Issue)  
**Type:** Poor Error Handling

### Description
The Unix socket transport completely silenced JSON parsing errors, making debugging communication issues extremely difficult. While this prevented crashes, it also hid legitimate parsing problems that could indicate protocol issues or data corruption.

### Root Cause
```typescript
// POOR ERROR HANDLING:
try {
  const message = JSON.parse(line);
  if (this.onmessage) {
    this.onmessage(message);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // console.error("[UnixSocket] Failed to parse message:", error);
  // Don't propagate parse errors as they might be recoverable
}
```

Completely silent error handling made debugging impossible.

### Fix Applied
Added proper logging while maintaining stability:
```typescript
// IMPROVED ERROR HANDLING:
try {
  const message = JSON.parse(line);
  if (this.onmessage) {
    this.onmessage(message);
  }
} catch (error) {
  // Log parse errors for debugging while keeping non-critical errors from crashing the transport
  console.warn(`[UnixSocket] Failed to parse message from ${this.socketPath}:`, error, "Raw line:", line.substring(0, 100) + (line.length > 100 ? "..." : ""));
  // Only continue processing other messages, don't crash the entire transport
}
```

### Impact
- **Before:** Silent failures made debugging communication issues impossible
- **After:** Proper logging helps identify protocol issues while maintaining application stability

## Additional Security Considerations

### Other JSON.parse Usage
During the audit, I found 15+ instances of `JSON.parse()` usage throughout the codebase. While most had some error handling, this review highlights the importance of:

1. **Always wrapping JSON.parse in try-catch blocks**
2. **Logging parsing errors for debugging**
3. **Validating parsed data structure before use**
4. **Providing meaningful error messages to users**

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Create a safe JSON parsing utility function** that all modules can use
2. **Implement input validation schemas** for all JSON parsing operations
3. **Add comprehensive error logging** throughout the application
4. **Consider using libraries like Zod** for runtime type checking and validation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test malformed JSON inputs** for all endpoints that parse JSON
2. **Test stdin handling** with various input scenarios
3. **Test Unix socket communication** with corrupted or partial messages
4. **Add integration tests** for error handling paths

## Conclusion

These fixes address critical stability and security issues in the Furikake CLI. The application is now more robust against malformed input, provides better error feedback, and maintains better debugging capabilities while preserving operational stability.
